The inventory management is another aspect that needs proper planning and reduced timings and more systematic working environment can help us deal with this problem. Also synchronization between the retailer/vendor/supplier and the delivery management system and the customer is another difficulty. With this proposed logistics management system these problems are promisingly dealt with. This is an application to manage an optimized solution for local logistics and transportation needs for both businesses and consumers in the urban areas. Timely delivery of goods and products to appropriate customer is necessary. The prevalent logistics systems are efficient but not effective enough. There are multiple drawbacks which eventually lead to the loss of the customer. The proposed logistics management system aims to achieve an integrated logistics system which entirely controls the logistics and also controls the route of the trucks to the said destination with care on time. The system also comes with a comprehensive route tracker which helps to find the optimal route for the delivery of products and also keeps a track of a group of trucks. Thus, the proposed system helps the drivers and their supervisors to ensure safe, secure and proper delivery of items.

The proposed system has a comprehensive logistics management app where every driver can feed in the source and destination addresses, and can simultaneously watch authorized truck driver's routes along with timing estimations of their arrival, consequently allowing them to make better routing desicions. Once registered the application allows the user to create group chats of other users they would like to supervise. Using google Api optimal route tracking is taken care of, our main concern lies in integrating everyone's routes together.
